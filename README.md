### Overview ###
Greetings to the Fraud Detection Project! This initiative centers around examining a dataset enriched with diverse financial transaction features, primarily geared towards the detection of fraudulent activities. The dataset encompasses crucial information, including distance metrics, purchase behavior, transaction security details, and an indicator for potential online transactions. In our pursuit, we've employed sophisticated algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. Our central objective is to construct a predictive model capable of effectively pinpointing and flagging potentially fraudulent transactions.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and join us in the mission to enhance financial security through advanced analytics and machine learning methodologies. Happy exploring!


### Introduction ###
Fraud detection is a critical aspect of financial transactions. This project leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to build a model that can predict fraudulent activities based on various transaction features.

### Objectives ###
#### Fraud Detection: ####

Develop a predictive model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
Behavioral Analysis:

Investigate the relationship between transaction features and legitimate transactions.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to better understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
